"""PushShapesScene — push three differently-shaped blocks onto their matching pads.

A multi-stage extension of RoboDojo's single-block ``push_T``. Three plates (T, X, L) start
in a row in front of the robot, each yawed away from its pad; three colour-keyed pads sit
in a row beyond them. Solving requires, per piece, a pivot push to correct yaw and a
translation to seat it — and doing so without knocking an already-seated neighbour out of
tolerance, which is what makes the pad row deliberately tight.

Why this shape of task: the single-push original needed no reorientation (block and pad
shared a yaw) and its rotation was clamped ~500x below the Isaac Lab default, so the
orientation tolerance only absorbed push-induced error instead of being a goal. Here yaw is
a goal, rotation is physical, and the per-piece correspondence gives real stages.

Progress is latched per stage in ``post_step`` (the suite's coffee/syringe idiom) so partial
credit survives a later mistake, while ``success()`` stays a LIVE conjunction — disturbing a
seated piece therefore still fails the run.

Source tolerances are preserved per piece: centre XY error at most 7 mm, orientation error
at most 7 degrees, and no lift above the bench. Heavy Isaac Lab imports stay deferred for
app-free discovery.
