"""SpatulaFlipServeScene — flip a bread slice in a fry pan, then serve it onto a plate (port).

The object world for the SimToolReal / DexToolBench "spatula flip & serve" port: a BREAD
slice lies in a FRY PAN, a bamboo PLATE waits beside it, a SPATULA rests on the bench.
**Goal (carried here, no task layer, per `cfg.goal` — the source curriculum):
v0 `serve` = slide the blade under the bread, carry it on the blade and set it down flat
on the plate; v1 `flip` = turn the bread over in place (it lands back in the pan);
v2 `flip_serve` = the full chain, flip first, then serve.**

This is the ported set's handheld-TOOL slot and its manipulation class is NON-PREHENSILE
payload control: the bread is never grasped — it rides a tool the robot holds, so success
is managing an unsecured cargo through wedging, a commit-point flip, and a friction-only
carry. TOOL-ONLY rule: finger/gripper contact with the bread disqualifies the episode —
that is an EMBODIMENT clause, checked at the robot-binding/harness layer, deliberately
not here (the scene is robot-agnostic — the pen-holder/stacking-toy return-to-origin precedent).

Judged by OUTCOME (the one flagged fidelity deviation from the source, which scores 6D
tool-pose trajectory following because it benchmarks policies; the deep survey showed the
source has NO payload — all payload physics here is new work). Staged flags, latched in
`post_step` (the microwave pattern), all geometric checks in the relevant BODY frame
(the pen-holder lesson):
  - `tool_lifted`  — the spatula blade is above the surface by `lift_gate` (the source's
                     own >5 cm lift-gate idea, kept);
  - `blade_under`  — the bread rides the blade (bread pose in the BLADE frame: inside the
                     blade footprint, bottom on the blade top, axes aligned) while still
                     down at pan-floor level — the wedge;
  - `flipped`      — the bread's body up-axis is inverted by >= `flip_min_deg` about a
                     horizontal axis AND it rests flat in the pan, settled (memoryless
                     orientation test);
  - `loaded`       — the bread rides the blade above `lift_gate` (the friction carry);
  - `served`       — the bread rests flat on the plate, settled, AND it ARRIVED ON THE
                     BLADE: the latch only fires within `arrival_window` steps of the last
                     loaded step (the contact-history clause — teleports, shoves and
                     lobbed tosses from across the bench never load at height, so they
                     never serve).
Score tables per goal (transition rubric, monotone prefix over the latched stages):
  serve       [10 lifted, 30 wedged, 60 loaded, 100 served]
  flip        [10 lifted, 30 wedged, 100 flipped]
  flip_serve  [10 lifted, 25 wedged, 50 flipped, 70 loaded-after-flip, 100 served]
Metrics for the brief: `max_carry_tilt_deg` (the blade's worst tilt while loaded — the
finesse number; the smoke's calibration sweep publishes the tilt budget the carry
tolerates) and `spills` (payload-drop events: the bread at rest on the bare bench after
having been loaded).

Assets are SCANNED PRODUCT MODELS (assets/kitchen, authored by
scripts/author_kitchen_rigs.py — the pc_motherboard visual+invisible-collider pattern;
every number below is measured from the scans, see kitchen_parts.json):
  - spatula (a molded red turner): origin at the BLADE-BOTTOM CENTER, +x toward the
    blade tip, +z up — the scan's inclined blade plane is leveled at authoring so the
    rubric and any oracle work directly in blade coordinates. Colliders: three thin
    tapered blade boxes (the molded blade thickens heel-ward; the tip box stays the thin
    leading edge the wedge needs), a neck box and a handle box on the 21 deg incline.
    The blade carries NO climbing feature — the wedge mechanic lives on the payload's
    rounded edge (GPU rounds 1-3 lesson, unchanged).
  - bread (a scan of a real slice, laid flat, ~6.2 cm across, 2.2 cm thick): collider =
    the slice's own CONVEX HULL (cooked from a face-subsampled proxy) — the scan's
    rounded crust edge IS the chamfer that makes wedging well-posed: any tip contact on
    it has an up-forward normal, so a sliding blade converts advance to lift by
    construction; near-symmetric top/bottom, so a FLIPPED slice re-wedges. Three sizes
    spawn (uniform scales of one scan) and ONE is present per episode (the pen-holder
    parking-depot pattern) — the size randomization axis.
  - fry pan (a 27 cm tri-ply pan, its lid dropped at authoring) and bamboo plate
    (30 cm): KINEMATIC bodies with EXACT triangle-mesh colliders — the concave bowl,
    rim and plate recess collide true to the scan. The pan replaces the flat cutting
    board: its RIM (5.3 cm) walls the payload in, so the wedge becomes a pitched
    over-the-rim entry and the wall itself is the anchor a jab pins the bread against
    (a real pan-corner scoop), and every lift-out must clear the rim.

Per-episode randomization (task-family knobs): bread size (one of three), bread pose in
the pan (xy jitter + yaw), plate position (xy jitter), pan yaw, spatula rest pose (xy
jitter + yaw). `reset()` judges the sampled episode.

Embodied bindings hold the tool through the weld-on-closure grasp contract (the
pc_motherboard pattern, ported verbatim; one site = the spatula's handle): close the
fingers across the handle and the tool welds to the hand, open wide to release. No-op
under robot="null" — the NullRobot smoke drives the tool kinematically instead.

Heavy imports (isaaclab, pxr) are deferred so importing this module — and registering
the scene — stays app-free.
