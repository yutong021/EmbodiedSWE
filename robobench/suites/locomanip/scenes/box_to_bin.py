"""BoxToBinScene — a cardboard box picked off a shelf board and carried to a sorting bin on a low table.

A steel shelving unit stands in front of the robot's start pose with a 20 cm cardboard box on its
middle board; a low table with an open blue sorting bin stands about 1.4 m away around a ~100 deg
turn. Goal (carried here — no task layer): pick the box off the shelf, carry it to the table, and
leave it resting inside the bin. Like `wheel_carry`, the distance is the point — the bin is past any
fixed-base reach, so the task cannot be finished without the robot moving its own base — but the
route adds what `wheel_carry`'s straight corridor does not: a genuine heading change.

**Nothing about the robot is in here** — the scene is embodiment-agnostic, as every `BaseScene` is.

LINEAGE. This is a measured port of IsaacLab-Arena's `galileo_g1_locomanip_pick_and_place` task
(github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab-Arena). Every default below is a number MEASURED off that task's
assets rather than re-invented: the same brown box (0.20 m, 0.1 kg, friction 5.0), the same
`SM_OpenIndustrialSteelShelving_A03` shelf with the box on the 0.763 m board, the same
`sm_tabletop_a01` table z-scaled 0.70 so its top lands at 0.531 m, and the same blue sorting bin
scaled (4, 2, 1) to a 0.80 x 0.50 m tray with 5 cm walls. Arena's frame (robot facing +x) is rotated
+90 deg so the layout meets this repo's convention (a G1 spawns at the origin facing +y, no
placement override needed): the shelf face is 0.46 m ahead of the start pose, exactly Arena's
stand-off, and the bin sits to the robot's right where Arena's navigation waypoints send it. See
`assets/fetch_galileo_assets.py` for asset provenance (Arena's own USDs, vendored + extracted).

GEOMETRY. Everything stands on the floor at z = 0 — no sunk furniture here (unlike `wheel_carry`):
the shelf and table assets put their feet at their origin, so world heights read straight off the
assets. The shelf's three boards land at 0.375-0.413 / 0.725-0.763 / 1.449-1.488 m; the box rests on
the MIDDLE board (top 0.763) with 0.69 m of clear air to the board above, so the pick is a
waist-height front approach. The bin's interior floor is ~3 mm above the table top with the rim at
+0.051 — a flat tray the box cannot roll out of, but shallow enough that `placed()` must tell
"resting inside" apart from "balanced on the rim" (the height band does exactly that).

Heavy imports (isaaclab, pxr) are deferred so importing this module stays app-free.
