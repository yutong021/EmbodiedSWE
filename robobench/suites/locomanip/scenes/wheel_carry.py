"""WheelCarryScene — a steering wheel picked off one packing table and carried to a basket on another.

Two work stations, three metres apart, and a wheel that has to travel between them. That distance is
the whole point: it is past any fixed-base humanoid's reach, so the task cannot be solved without the
robot moving its own base. Goal (carried here — no task layer): pick the wheel up off the PICK table,
carry it to the PLACE table, and put it in the basket standing there.

**Nothing about the robot is in here** — the scene is embodiment-agnostic, as every `BaseScene` is.
It never mentions legs, walking, or a base command; it only puts the two stations far enough apart
that an embodiment without those cannot finish.

LINEAGE. This is `assembly.wheel_pick_place` with the basket taken three metres away, and the
numbers are deliberately inherited rather than re-derived: same steering wheel at the same
table-frame spot, same 0.694 m surface, same basket target bands, same friction band and sim
substrate. Each station reproduces `wheel_pick_place`'s validated standing geometry exactly — a
robot at the station's `stand_xy` sees precisely the layout it saw there — so any failure here is
attributable to the transit, not to a new reach problem.

GEOMETRY. Both tables are spawned at yaw 0 and differ only in x, `carry_dx` apart, which is what
keeps the target bands a plain offset instead of a rotation. The PICK station is the bare heavy-duty
table (no basket); the PLACE station is the full packing-table set piece, whose `container_h20`
basket is the target — so there is exactly ONE basket in the world and no ambiguity about which.
Station frames put their tops at `surface_z`; `table_z`/`scene_table_z` derive each asset's origin
from that, because the two USDs are authored at different scales (the bare table is in centimetres).

The ground plane stays at z = 0, which is where a floor-standing embodiment's feet belong, so the
tables' bottom 0.3 m is below it. That is what Isaac Lab's own G1 loco-manipulation env ships
(`packing_table` at z = -0.3 over a ground plane at 0), and it is what makes a 0.694 m work surface
reachable by a humanoid whose pelvis stands at 0.75. Raise `ground_z` to -0.3 to stand the tables on
their own feet instead — the work surfaces do not move, but they become a 0.994 m chest-height pick
and the inherited reach calibration no longer applies.

Heavy imports (isaaclab, pxr) are deferred so importing this module stays app-free.
