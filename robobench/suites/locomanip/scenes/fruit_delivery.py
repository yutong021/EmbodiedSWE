"""FruitDeliveryScene — fruits_on_plate stretched across a table no arm can span.

Registered as `fruit_delivery`; runnable presets are `locomanip.fruit_delivery` (NullRobot
oracle) and `locomanip.fruit_delivery.g1.{loco_joint,loco_pink_ik}` (the mobile G1).

THE TASK. A wooden kitchen table (authored after the one in RoboLab's `fruits_out_of_basket`
scene: warm oak top at 0.70 m on thin steel legs) carries the RoboLab produce tableau on the
robot's side: fruit to pick, mixed among produce and kitchenware that must stay put. The large
round clay plate stands ON THE SAME TABLE but across it, inset from the FAR edge. **Goal: pick
up every fruit and carry it around the table to the plate — the plate is out of reach from the
pick side, so the robot must walk.**

WHY THIS GEOMETRY MAKES IT LOCO-MANIPULATION, in one number each way: the table top is 1.00 m
deep and the plate's counted centre sits 0.20 m in from the far edge, so from the closest
pick-side stance the plate is >= 0.93 m from the shoulder — more than twice the G1's 0.44 m
fingertip ceiling, and unreachable BY CONSTRUCTION for any fixed stance on the pick side (the
robot cannot climb the table; `_assert_reach_separation` enforces the margin at build). The
transit around either table end is ~2.5 m of walking per delivery, done while carrying fruit
in a swaying hand.

The identification half is INHERITED VERBATIM from `packing.fruits_on_plate` (this class
subclasses it): fruit vs not-fruit, with produce distractors — pumpkins and a red onion — that
FAIL the task if they reach the plate, the plate-body-frame footprint+settle rubric, the same
score() (per-fruit progress to 90, -10 per misplaced non-fruit) and success() (every present
fruit placed, nothing else on the plate). What changes is the table, the layout, and that the
distance is now the hard part: pick-side geometry reproduces the fixed-base tier's measured
grasp cell, so the NEW skill this task grades on top of it is the carry.

LAYOUT (table-relative; the table centre is the origin, top 1.40 x 1.00 m at 0.70 m):
  * PICK ZONE (robot's side, y < 0): the fruit at the calibrated stance spot, the produce
    distractors around it, the long utensils along the near edge.
  * CENTRE BAND: serving bowl and storage box — the colourful mid-table clutter of the
    original scene, and a physical wall against reaching across.
  * FAR SIDE (y > 0): the clay plate, centred at `plate_pos`, inset from the far edge so a
    placing stance on the far side reproduces the fixed-base tier's plate reach.

Heavy imports (isaaclab, pxr) are deferred so importing this module stays app-free.
