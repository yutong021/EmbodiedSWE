"""SO101AssemblyScene — assemble the SO101 arm: seat + screw the elbow servo, attach the distal.

The assembly object-world:

  - `proximal`: base + shoulder + upper-arm shell as a FLOATING-base articulation (joints 1-2
    live).
  - `motor`: the bare elbow STS3215 as a free rigid body. KEY FRAME FACT: its body frame IS the
    upper_arm link frame, so "seated in the pocket" = identical body poses. The pocket is a
    slip fit — a straight, centered push inserts it.
  - `screw_0..3`: four IDENTICAL slim-head M2x6, free rigid bodies — the servo's four tab
    screws. Any screw fastens into any free hole (the pairing is order-independent).
  - `drill`: the compact power screwdriver articulation (body/trigger/bit).
  - `distal`: lower_arm..gripper as a floating articulation. Its root link `lower_arm` is a
    closed fork that clips over the seated servo — the drive-side cup onto the output horn,
    the far plate onto the back bearing post — and is locked by M3 screws (`horn_screw_0..3`)
    on the four peripheral screw lines around the elbow axis: near side through the fork's
    inner plate into the horn's metal holes (reached through the outer skin's access
    channels), far side through the far plate into the servo's case-back holes. The center
    bore on the axis is only driver access. The seated lower_arm pose relative to the motor
    is the elbow_flex joint transform at joint zero.

The servo is held by four M2 screws (upper_arm LINK frame): the NEAR pair enters the countersunk
outer wall from link -Z; the FAR pair enters from link +Z through the ring bosses on that face.
Each hole carries its own seat pose; the out-of-hole axis is derived from it, so both facings
run the same mechanic.

Everything rests on a WORKBENCH (a static table under the whole layout; its top is at
`surface_z` — by default the ikea_table scene's packing table standing on the floor, top at
0.994 m). Every body is free-floating; the only pre-authored joints are the DISABLED fastening
welds (the mechanic below).

THE FASTENING MECHANIC (rule-based for fast simulation — see `_fasten_rule`): one pre-authored
DISABLED FixedJoint per screw, its seat frame authored at enable time (so any screw can take any
hole in its own group); a per-step gate (screw in a free hole + parts aligned + bit on that
screw + trigger on) advances the screw kinematically with a latched depth and snaps its weld on
at the seat. The holes come in per-joint GROUPS, each with its own seat link and part-alignment
check: any fastened elbow tab screw welds motor<->upper_arm; the fastened horn screws CLOSE THE
DRIVEN ELBOW JOINT (a revolute about the horn axis with the servo's drive — the assembled robot
articulates; command it via set_elbow_target). THE MAGNETIC BIT (same section): a free screw whose head
touches the bit tip attaches and rides it, coaxial and spinning, until driven home — real M2
driving carries the screw on a magnetized bit, and any embodiment holding the drill can use it.
THE AUTO-DRIVER: the trigger is torque-activated — the scene squeezes it while a carried screw
is seated in a free hole with everything aligned, so seating the screw is the task, not
squeezing the trigger.
Everything else is real collision against the parts' actual holes and walls.

Heavy imports (isaaclab, pxr) are deferred so importing this module stays app-free.

        drives into any FREE, COMPATIBLE hole h while ALL of these hold, re-checked every step:

          1. SCREW IN A FREE HOLE — screw axis within `gate_axis_deg` of the hole axis, head
             center within `gate_radial` of the axis, inside the engagement window
             (`gate_window_below` below the seat .. `gate_window` above it — the axis check
             is waived below the seat, where the bore constrains the screw), no other screw
             fastened there, and the screw fits the hole (`_pair_ok`: M2 tab screws vs the
             elbow tab holes, the M3 horn screw vs the horn hole);
          2. PARTS ALIGNED      — the hole's JOINT is seated within `motor_align_pos` /
             `motor_align_deg`: a tab hole needs the servo in the arm pocket (their frames
             coincide exactly when seated); the horn hole needs the lower_arm on the motor's
             horn (at the elbow joint transform);
          3. DRIVER ON THE SCREW — bit tip within `bit_on_head` of that screw's head-top, bit
             axis within `bit_axis_deg` of the screw axis;
          4. TRIGGER ON          — squeezed past 70% AND the bit actually spinning (>
             `spin_min`). With `auto_trigger` (default) the scene itself squeezes the
             trigger while conditions 1-3 hold — the driver is torque-activated, so
             actuating the trigger is not part of the manipulation.

        While driving, the screw moves along its hole's axis TOWARD the seat at `drive_rate` —
        descending if engaged above it, drawn back up if it lies deep in the hole — spinning
        with the bit (kinematic-follow with a LATCHED depth; pilot pushback must not slow the
        schedule). Reaching the seat after >= `min_drive_s` enables that screw's pre-authored
        weld; any fastened tab screw also holds the motor<->arm weld on, and the fastened horn
        screw the lower_arm<->motor weld: FASTENED until reset. Any condition breaking mid-drive
        returns the screw to free dynamics on the spot.
