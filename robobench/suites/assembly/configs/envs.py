"""Canonical runnable env configs for the assembly suite — registered in `ENVS` by name.

Each binds the suite's scene to an embodiment + control mode + sim, so a run or smoke test loads one
by name, instead of wiring scene/robot/mode by hand. `register_env` derives the canonical name by the
convention ``suite.scene[.robot[.control_mode]]`` (segments dropped from the right when default/absent),
so names stay consistent as scenes/robots multiply — e.g. this suite's `SUITE="assembly"` + scene
`ikea_table` + no robot -> ``assembly.ikea_table``. Factories (a fresh `EnvCfg` per call) keep one
build from mutating another's cfg.

These are the *baseline* bindings; curriculum/debug variants are cheap `dataclasses.replace(cfg, ...)`
derivations the harness or agent can make — nothing here is locked.

# link0 footprint (x [-0.154, +0.072] x y +-0.095) on the top plate, and the two stick holders
# sit west of it at world (0.30, -0.36) and (0.42, -0.36) — reaches: picks 0.42 / 0.30 m, slots
# 0.376 / 0.365 m, all in the arm's accurate band. The sticks cannot start in the scene's lying
# default (flat, their 7.3 mm thickness points up — no parallel-jaw pinch off the table), so the
# gripper env stages them UPRIGHT in the scene's foam holders, already in the seated

# spawn points. sim dt 1/240, the depth the force-driven pc_ram smoke runs at.

# (0.28, -0.36). Both fit fully on the lab table's top plate — x [-0.32, 0.96] x y [-0.47, 0.44]
# in world, with panda link0's footprint spanning x [-0.154, +0.072] x y +-0.095 around the base
# origin, so the 0.26 m-deep strip only fits it with the rear foot pointing +-x. Reach stays in
# the arm's accurate band: pick 0.36 m near dead-ahead, placement 0.393 m / seat 0.384 m at
# ~74 deg right, and the rearward slide runs slightly radially inward. (A base much beyond
# ~0.45 m from the seat saturates the top-down arm several mm short — more than the channel's
# 1.5 mm end-stop play.) The case stays at the table preset's 0.5 m. The loose card cannot
# start in the scene's lying default:
# flat on its backplate its only sub-80 mm dimension (the 36 mm body thickness) points UP, so no
# parallel-jaw pinch can take it off the table. The gripper env therefore stages it UPRIGHT in the
# scene's foam holder (`card_stand=True`), already in the seated orientation — one top-down
# fingertip grip on the card's top edge (see the smoke's grasp-geometry note) then serves pick,
# carry, slide and press, with no re-orientation anywhere near the case. Deterministic spawn (no
# jitter): the holder is static geometry authored at the spawn point, so a jittered card would

# (WXAI ~0.5 m -> y = +/-0.30, PiPER ~0.6 m -> +/-0.35); the Frankas face off ALONG the bench
# (y = 0) instead — the top is only +/-0.38 in y, too narrow for their bases. The Franka pair is
# asymmetric on purpose: the slab (x in [-0.75, -0.15]) is a keep-out, so the "pin/left-drag" arm
# sits behind it at (-0.95, 0.0) (slab side, faces +x) and the "threader/leg-cycle" arm at
# (0.25, -0.25) (leg-row side, yaw 180 deg), workspaces overlapping around the slab edge.
# The Franka bases + leg spawn below are load-bearing calibrated constants — do not move them.
# CAUTION: the small pairs' base poses / reachability are NOT fully verified yet — starting guesses.

#   - the workbench is lowered to a ~0.7 m top (surface_z=0.7; the bench sinks below the floor, like
#     Isaac's pick-place env) so the parts sit around chest height instead of at the neck;
#   - the G1 stands slightly BACK of the table (base_pos -0.6 m in y, facing +y) so it reaches forward.
