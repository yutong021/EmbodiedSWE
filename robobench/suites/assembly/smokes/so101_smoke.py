"""Smoke test for SO101AssemblyScene — one linear run with a NullRobot (visual or headless).

THE POINT OF THIS TEST: prove that a real robot could plausibly perform every step. Each motion
here is one a robot embodiment can produce — a force push, a carried tool, or a scene rule an
embodiment triggers through contact (the fasten gate, the magnetic bit). The only test
scaffolding is the base clamp (a stand-in for a bench vise) and the re-fixturing teleports
between holes (a stand-in for re-clamping the workpiece).

Assembles the WHOLE elbow joint: the servo into the upper-arm pocket, its four M2 tab screws,
the forearm fork onto the output horn, and the eight M3 horn screws (four per fork side). All
twelve screws are picked up and carried to their holes on the drill's MAGNETIC BIT — how real
small-screw assembly is done: nothing holds a freely released screw upright in these holes (it
topples off the countersink or slides past the pin), so placement belongs to the bit, not to
gravity. Within each group the screws are identical and the scene's gate pairs any screw with
any free compatible hole.

The arm is steadied during the precision phases: before each, the smoke teleports it to the
working pose for the TARGET hole — near holes face up in the lying pose, far holes face up in a
flipped pose — and clamps its base there kinematically; it runs free the rest of the time.
Because the target hole's axis always points up, one pickup/carry/drive choreography serves
every hole. The procedure, in order:
  A) WIGGLE  — everything free; sinusoidal targets on the shoulder (1-2) and wrist (4-5 + gripper)
     joints, then back to zero. Proof the parts are live, not glued.
  B) INSERT  — a second hand (PD force at the CoM, orientation gripped) pushes the servo through
     the open approach to the corridor mouth, then slides it centered down the slip-fit corridor
     to the seat (kinematic — a force push wanders off-axis and jams against the printed walls);
     a firm kinematic press then holds it until the first screw bites.
  C) ROTATE  — joint 2 swings the arm flat under its own drive (the base clamp keeps it steady).
  Then, for each of the four M2 tab holes (near pair lying, far pair flipped):
  D) PLACE   — re-grab facing that hole up; the drill hovers over the lying screw, descends,
     and the MAGNETIC BIT takes it (a scene rule, like the gate), then lifts it off the workbench.
  E) DESCEND — the drill carries the screw over the hole and lowers it straight in, tip-first.
  F) DRIVE   — trigger -> gate -> the screw drives to its seat -> weld at depth (the first tab
     screw also welds motor->arm and the hand releases the servo).
  G) RETREAT — the drill retreats gently to its hover.
  H) ATTACH  — the drill parks; back in the lying pose, a hand clips the forearm FORK over the
     seated servo (the closed fork is a print-flex snap in the kit — the hand presses it on
     along the elbow axis and keeps HOLDING it until the first horn screw bites).
  Then, for each of the eight M3 horn holes (near four lying, far four flipped), the same
  D/E/F/G pickup-carry-drive-retreat: the near heads seat on the fork's inner plate, reached
  down the outer skin's access channels, threading into the horn; the far heads seat on the
  far plate over the servo's case-back holes. The first M3 also welds lower_arm->motor.
  I) STRESS  — knock a fastened M2 and an M3, wrench the servo and the forearm; nothing may
     come apart.
  J) FINALE  — the clamp lifts the WHOLE robot (both halves now), shakes it, rotates 180 deg,
     sets it down and RELEASES it: the robot rests assembled on the workbench.

Re-grabbing with welded parts attached does the teleport WELD-SAFE (see `grab`): welds off, arm
teleported, the welded CHAIN (motor, fork, every screw) re-seated at the fresh pose by the
scene's reconciler, welds back on — never letting an enabled weld see a large error (that yanks
the parts across the workspace). The drill PARKS clear before every re-fixture: a teleporting
arm sweeping through a hole-tracking drill collides mid-flip.
