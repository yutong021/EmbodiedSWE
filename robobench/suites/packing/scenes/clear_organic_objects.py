"""ClearOrganicObjectsScene — RoboLab's **ClearOrganicObjectsTask**, ported.

Registered as `clear_organic_objects`; runnable presets are `packing.clear_organic_objects`
(NullRobot oracle), `packing.clear_organic_objects.franka.{osc,diff_ik,pink_ik,joint}` and
`packing.clear_organic_objects.g1.{joint,pink_ik}` (the G1 humanoid works a resized cell — a
smaller bin and the four smallest organics — because its pinch hand and fixed pelvis are not an
80 mm jaw on a 0.8 m arm; see `_clear_organic_objects_g1_cfg`).

A port of NVlabs/RoboLab's `ClearOrganicObjectsTask`
(github.com/NVlabs/RoboLab/blob/main/robolab/tasks/benchmark/clutter_organic_objects_task.py):
a work table strewn with organic fruits & vegetables mixed among non-food clutter (bottles,
jugs, a serving bowl, a pen holder), and an open bin off to one side. **Goal (carried here,
no task layer): identify every organic item — the fruits and vegetables — and place each into
the bin, leaving the non-food clutter on the table.**

The objects are the RoboLab assets themselves, vendored by
`scripts/vendor_clear_organic_objects_assets.py` into `suites/packing/assets/clear_organic_objects/` (real
scanned USDs — Z-up, metres, authored RigidBody + mesh colliders; textures downsampled to 2K).
The organics are the 11 RoboLab targets — two lemons, two limes, two oranges, a pomegranate, a
large and a small pumpkin, a red onion, an avocado; the clutter is the 5 RoboLab distractors —
a white packer bottle, a crab pen holder, a milk jug, a serving bowl, a utility jug. The bin is
RoboLab's `container_f24`, kept at its scene scale (0.3, 0.3, 0.2) -> a ~0.35 x 0.24 m open
crate, 0.13 m deep; spawned KINEMATIC (a fixed receptacle on the bench).

Judged in the BIN'S BODY FRAME (the pen-holder / tool-packing lesson: a container judges
identically wherever it sits): an item is IN the bin when its origin lies inside the bin's
interior box — |x| <= `wall_frac` * outer_half_x, |y| <= `wall_frac` * outer_half_y, and
`floor_local_z` <= z <= scaled rim height — computed from the measured `bin_bbox` x `bin_scale`.
An item is CLEARED when it is in the bin AND settled (|v| < `settle_speed`).

`success()` = every PRESENT organic cleared into the bin AND no distractor in the bin (the
identification is the task: dumping everything in is NOT success). This is stricter than
RoboLab's own `object_in_container(organics, "all")`, which does not check distractors — the
deviation is deliberate and documented. RoboLab's `require_gripper_detached` clause is an
EMBODIMENT clause (the arm not still holding a placed item), checked at the robot-binding /
harness layer per the repo convention (the pen-holder return-to-origin precedent), not in this
robot-agnostic scene — here the `settle_speed` gate already rejects an item still being carried.

`score()` 0..100: per-present-organic progress up to 90, minus 10 per distractor in the bin,
100 only once every present organic is cleared and no distractor is in the bin.

Per-episode randomization (task-family knobs): item scatter poses (grid slot + xy jitter +
free yaw), optional slot shuffle, and optional organic-subset sampling (`subset_sample`) so a
memorised fixed pick list fails and a graded floor of episodes stays solvable. Absent organics
park in an off-camera ground depot (InteractiveScene cannot despawn).

Heavy imports (isaaclab, pxr) are deferred so importing this module — and registering the
scene — stays app-free.
