"""FruitsOnPlateScene — RoboLab's **FruitsOnPlateTask**, ported.

Registered as scene `fruits_on_plate` but NOT a catalog task: it has no env preset of its own.
The class is kept as the base of `locomanip.fruit_delivery` (which inherits the identification
half of the rubric verbatim) and its vendored assets are shared with `clear_organic_objects`.

A port of NVlabs/RoboLab's `FruitsOnPlateTask`
(github.com/NVlabs/RoboLab/blob/main/robolab/tasks/benchmark/fruits_to_plate.py): a kitchen
work table strewn with FRUIT mixed among things that are not fruit — two pumpkins, a red onion,
a serving bowl, wooden spoons, a spatula, a storage box — and a large round clay plate standing
on the table. **Goal (carried here, no task layer): pick up every fruit and place it on the
plate, leaving everything else where it is.**

The identification is finer-grained than the sibling `clear_organic_objects` scene, and that is
the point of having both. There, the split is FOOD vs NON-FOOD, and a pumpkin and an onion are
targets. Here the split is FRUIT vs NOT-FRUIT, so the pumpkins and the onion are DISTRACTORS
even though they are produce, sitting on the same table as the lemons and limes. An agent that
resolves "organic" cannot pass this task by the same reasoning; it has to resolve "fruit".
RoboLab draws the line in exactly this place — its success term lists the seven fruits and its
contact list carries the pumpkins, the onion and the tableware as scenery.

The GOAL SURFACE is a plate, not a container, and that changes the rubric rather than just the
target pose. RoboLab judges with `object_on_top(fruit, "clay_plates",
require_gripper_detached=True)`, which is the AND of a contact-force cone test (the surface
pushes up on the fruit within 45 deg of vertical) and a footprint test (the fruit's centroid xy
lies inside the surface's bounds). This scene keeps the footprint half verbatim and replaces the
contact-cone half with a settle gate, for the same reason the sibling scene does: contact-force
reads are embodiment- and solver-sensitive, while "resting still, inside the footprint, above
the dish floor" is the thing a rubric can state robot-agnostically.

Judged in the PLATE'S BODY FRAME (the pen-holder / tool-packing lesson: a receptacle judges
identically wherever it sits). A fruit is ON the plate when, measured from the plate's
GEOMETRIC CENTRE (not its prim origin — see `PLATE_MIN`/`PLATE_MAX`, the asset's origin sits
13 mm off-centre in x and 19 mm in y), its radial distance is within `radius_frac` of the
scaled plate radius AND its local z lies between `floor_local_z` and the scaled rim height plus
`stack_local_z`. A fruit is PLACED when it is on the plate AND settled (|v| < `settle_speed`).

`success()` = every PRESENT fruit placed on the plate AND nothing that is not a fruit on it
(the identification is the task: sweeping the whole table onto the plate is NOT success). This
is stricter than RoboLab's own fruits-only check — the deviation is deliberate and documented,
and it is the same deviation the sibling scene makes. RoboLab's `require_gripper_detached`
clause is an EMBODIMENT clause (the arm not still holding a placed item), checked at the robot-
binding / harness layer per the repo convention, not in this robot-agnostic scene — here the
`settle_speed` gate already rejects an item still being carried.

`score()` 0..100: per-present-fruit progress up to 90, minus 10 per non-fruit on the plate, 100
only once every present fruit is placed and the plate holds nothing else.

Per-episode randomization (task-family knobs): item scatter poses (grid slot + xy jitter + free
yaw), optional slot shuffle, and optional fruit-subset sampling (`subset_sample`) so a memorised
fixed pick list fails and a graded floor of episodes stays solvable. Absent fruits park in an
off-camera ground depot (InteractiveScene cannot despawn).

Assets: the plate and the kitchenware are the RoboLab `hot3d` assets, vendored by
`scripts/vendor_fruits_on_plate_assets.py` into `suites/packing/assets/fruits_on_plate/`. The
PRODUCE is the identical RoboLab `fruits_veggies` / `vomp` set already vendored for the sibling
scene, so this one reads it from `suites/packing/assets/clear_organic_objects/` rather than
keeping a second ~190 MB copy of the same meshes in the repo.

Heavy imports (isaaclab, pxr) are deferred so importing this module — and registering the
scene — stays app-free.
