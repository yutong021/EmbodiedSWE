"""ToolPackingScene — stow three tools into an articulated drawer cabinet, then shut it.

The refined successor of the pen-holder floor task, on real scanned assets. A drawer
cabinet stands on the work table with a stapler, a pair of scissors and a utility knife
scattered in front of it. **Goal (carried here, no task layer): open the cabinet as
needed, put each tool in its ASSIGNED drawer, close every drawer (and any doors).**

Two selectable cabinets (`cabinet`, see `CABINETS`), both vendored by
`scripts/vendor_tool_packing_assets.py` in cap-x:
  - "chest" (default): the Movian 4-drawer chest — a doorless high-gloss cabinet, scan
    split in vendoring into base + four prismatic drawer links (0.118 m travel), each
    drawer a scanned front panel + its REAL pull handle (93 x 14 mm, 14 mm proud — an
    honest pinch target) + an authored tray (floor + walls box colliders). Three drawers
    are assigned (top/second/third); the fourth is a distractor that stays shut.
  - "toolbox": the plastic parts cabinet — 2 revolute translucent doors covering 3
    prismatic drawers (0.25 m travel); the doors made this the strictly harder variant.
  - items: each flattened in vendoring to ONE rigid body frozen at rest pose (the scans are
    articulated — stapler hinge, scissors pivot, retractable blade — but loose floppy items
    would tax grasping, settle time and memory (per-link SDF), all off-goal here); collision
    is convexDecomposition. The stapler spawns scaled 0.55: at full size it is 81 mm tall
    against the ~50-62 mm bays — a real stapler that does not fit the real box is an asset
    mismatch, not a task.

Judged in each DRAWER'S BODY FRAME (the pen-holder lesson: a moving container judges
identically wherever it is): an item is STOWED in its assigned drawer when its origin lies
inside that drawer's tray-interior box (`tray_center` +/- `tray_half`, measured from the
vendored asset), whatever the drawer's slide position. A drawer is CLOSED when its joint is
within `drawer_closed_tol` of 0 (limits [-travel, 0], 0 = shut), a door when within
`door_closed_deg` of 0. Score: 20 per stowed item, +10 per stowed item whose drawer is shut,
+10 once everything is stowed and shut (doors included, when the cabinet has any) -> 0..100.
`success()` = full score, settled. Items must go through the real openings — the cabinet
interior is only reachable through out-slid drawers (and past doors on the toolbox);
nothing is welded, ordering emerges from the geometry.

Per-episode randomization (task-family knobs): item scatter poses (slot row + xy jitter +
free yaw, lying flat) and optional item->slot permutation, so a memorized fixed pick order
fails. The box pose gets xy jitter + yaw jitter around its nominal.

Embodiment-agnostic: items and joints are scene objects the robot reaches through
`env.scene`; a NullRobot smoke drives drawers/doors by joint writes and items by kinematic
staging. Heavy imports (isaaclab, pxr) are deferred so importing this module stays app-free.
