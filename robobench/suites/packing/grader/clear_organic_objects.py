"""Grader for the clear_organic_objects scene: every organic in the bin, nothing else in it.

Rubric stages (weights and modes live in RUBRIC):
    organics_cleared  fraction of the required placements that hold right now — in the
                      legacy variant every PRESENT organic cleared into the bin (the scene's
                      `cleared()`: origin inside the bin's interior box in the bin's body
                      frame, settled); in the sort variant (`sort_to_bin` / `sort_to_tray`)
                      the scene's own `bin_targets` cleared plus its `tray_targets` resting
                      on the tray. The organics are interchangeable sub-goals, so they share
                      this one fraction stage. It is GATED by the two sanity predicates
                      below: the whole stage reads 0 while either fails, and recovers when
                      the state is repaired (live)
Gates (no weight of their own — rule 7 sanity predicates on the one and only stage, which
is also the done stage):
    no distractor in the bin   the scene's `distractors_in_bin()` — identification IS the
                               task: dumping everything in must not score as progress
    bin upright                the bin's up-axis within its own topple angle of world-up, the
                               angle (from `bin_bbox` x `bin_scale`) past which a free crate's
                               centre leaves its base and it falls onto its side. A knocked-
                               over bin with produce inside it must not pass. The default bin
                               is kinematic and cannot move, so this only bites in the
                               dynamic-bin variant
Success is the scene's own `success()` (every required placement holds, no distractor in the
bin) AND the bin upright, on the final state. `progress == 1` exactly when that holds.

Not measured: a grasped/lifted rung per item (the scene exposes no lift height or hold
criterion) and "bin in place" (a positional test would need an invented tolerance; the
body-frame judging already makes a moved bin judge identically).
