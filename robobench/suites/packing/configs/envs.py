    """G1 humanoid (fixed pelvis, ~0.51 m to the fingertips): the SAME task in a cell resized
    to a short-armed, torso-fixed embodiment reaching over a standing bench with a three-finger
    hand instead of a parallel jaw.

    Three dials carry the whole difference from the franka binding, each forced by measured
    geometry rather than taste:

    * `surface_z` 0.78 (vs the franka's 0.55). The pelvis is welded at 0.75 and the shoulders
      sit 0.25 m above it, so the arm's usable HORIZONTAL radius is
      `sqrt(0.51^2 - (shoulder_z - work_z)^2)` — every centimetre the work sits below the
      shoulder is spent going down instead of out. At the repo's usual G1 bench (0.7) that
      leaves 0.30 m of drop and only ~0.41 m of extreme (~0.30 m usable) radius, too little
      to hold a scatter grid AND a bin. At 0.78 the drop is 0.22 m and the radius ~0.46 m
      extreme / ~0.36 m usable — which the layout below fits. Scaling the G1's 1.0 m shoulder
      to a human's ~1.4 m, this is a ~1.1 m standing bench: high, but a real one.
    * a SMALLER bin — `bin_scale` (0.20, 0.22, 0.17) -> a ~23 x 18 cm crate 11 cm deep, a third
      of the franka binding's footprint. It has to fit beside the scatter inside one 0.36 m
      annulus, and it only ever holds the reduced organic set below (four fruits of 40-76 mm sit
      in one layer inside the ~21 x 16 cm counted interior). The shallow walls also matter: the
      rim lands 0.15 m under the shoulder, so releasing over it does not ask the arm to reach up
      and out at once.
    * a REDUCED item set (5 of 16). The G1 hand is a three-finger pinch — two fingers with
      45.8 mm phalanges opposing a thumb — not an 80 mm parallel jaw, so it has BOTH an upper and
      a LOWER size bound, and the organics have to sit between them:
        - upper: usable opposition width is ~86 mm (thumb parked), so the 62-65 mm spheres and the
          two tall ellipsoids the franka binding also drops are out;
        - lower: the pad-to-pad gap never closes below ~70 mm (measured), so anything much under
          ~50 mm cannot be pinched at all — it simply does not fill the hand. lemon_02, at 40 mm
          across its short axis, failed to lift in EVERY grasp configuration tried, in two
          different hand orientations. It is excluded as unpickable by construction rather than
          left in as false difficulty.
        - SHAPE, not just span: lime01 (76 x 61 x 60 mm) is also excluded, and its span is inside
          the bounds. Swept across the full circle of approach azimuths it is never liftable,
          while lemon_01 (76 x 50 x 51 mm) is, at the same spot. The difference is that the lemon has
          a genuinely flat-ish 50 mm short axis for a grasp to seat on and the near-spherical lime
          does not — it rolls out of a three-finger hand the way it would out of a human's
          fingertips.
      That leaves two: lemon_01 (50 mm) and pumpkinsmall (55 mm), both liftable. Two
      organics is a thin board and a deliberate call — a G1 tier that reliably does two is worth
      more than one that unreliably attempts four.
      The clutter keeps the bottle and the pen holder and drops the three space hogs —
      the 160 mm serving bowl, the 171 mm utility jug and the milk jug. The jug goes for a second
      reason: at 172 mm it is the one item taller than the height a loaded hand traverses at, so it
      is the only thing on the table a carry could catch. Identification still means telling food
      from non-food, on a smaller board.

    Layout (table-relative; MEASURED — the right shoulder lands at world (0.100, -0.500, 1.042)
    with the pelvis at (0, -0.50, 0.75) facing +y, i.e. 0.262 m above this surface): scatter grid
    3 x 2 at (-0.02, -0.27) spanning 0.24 x 0.10 m, and the bin beside it at (0.29, -0.31).

    The reachable region is an ANNULUS about 0.20-0.34 m from the shoulder in the table plane,
    and it is smaller than it first looks. 0.438 m is the fingertip ceiling
    (`sqrt(0.51^2 - 0.262^2)`), but what has to arrive at the fruit is the PINCH ZONE, which sits
    ~66 mm short of the fingertips — so the working ceiling is ~0.34 m, and the inner bound is
    where the arm folds back on itself. Four limits pin the numbers, each one measured:

    * the OUTER bound is real: an earlier grid put its far-left slot 0.46 m out, and every
      azimuth tried there missed the hover pose by 215-292 mm.
    * the INNER bound is real too: a first guess (grid centre y -0.30) sat 0.12 m from the
      shoulder, where the arm must fold to reach straight down — the humanoid analogue of the
      franka binding's cramped inner shell.
    * the grid sits WEST of the bin, not spread across it. The hand approaches a pinch with its
      wrist offset ~0.14 m toward +x of the fruit (the pinch zone is out along the fingers, and
      every azimuth in the hand's usable band offsets the wrist the same way). A layout with the
      grid's east column at x 0.15, 60 mm from the bin wall, put the WRIST goal inside the
      crate's footprint at rim height and that column was unreachable (224-251 mm at every
      azimuth). Ending the grid at x 0.10 leaves the wrist clear above the rim.
    * the bin is pulled IN to 0.29: releasing over its centre puts the pinch zone 0.28 m out and
      0.07 m below the shoulder, comfortably inside the annulus.

    Grid pitch is 0.12 m in x and 0.10 m in y. 3 columns, not 4: four columns across the
    reachable width would space items 67 mm apart — less than the widest item — and a hand
    cannot descend between two touching items.

        #   depth) had the pelvis 7 cm and the knees 10 cm inside its footprint (probed world
        #   AABBs, 2026-09-01). The RoboLab wooden table is only 0.35 m half-deep, so at the
        #   ORIGINAL measured pelvis (-0.50) the whole body clears its near edge by ~6 cm --
        #   every measured grasp pocket from the shipped solve stays valid -- and with the
        #   legs z-scaled to a 0.78 top the ground lands at z=0, so the feet stand naturally
        #   on the floor. No riser, no reach re-derivation.
        # * TWO destinations: blue crate (right) for produce, round tray (left) for the
        #   non-food items. The tray is deliberately flat — placement on it cannot wedge or
        #   penetrate the way a second crate's walls could.
        # * The FULL 16-object manifest is on the table (the RoboLab original's colourful
