"""G1Robot — Unitree G1 humanoid, fixed base, upper-body manipulation.

The first concrete robobench embodiment. Wraps Isaac's `G1_29DOF_CFG` (29-DOF G1 with the
three-finger hands) but pins the pelvis (`fix_root_link=True`) so only the upper body acts — the
fixed-base manipulator of `Isaac-PickPlace-FixedBaseUpperBodyIK-G1-Abs-v0`. The USD is **vendored
locally** (`robots/assets/g1/`) so the package stays relocatable (no Nucleus path).

Control modes (the actuation of the *same* hardware — see CLAUDE.md "embodiment vs control mode").
All share one shape: a controller over the 17 arm+waist DOFs **+** direct joint targets for the 14
three-finger-hand DOFs, composed with `composite`. The mode swaps the arm controller, and the two
`loco_*` modes append a third leaf that drives the 12 leg DOFs:
  - `joint`         — arms+waist by `JointController` (action = 17 + 14 = 31 joint position targets).
  - `pink_ik`       — arms+waist by Pink IK (action = two wrist poses = 14, + 14 hands = 28).
  - `loco_pink_ik`  — `pink_ik` on a FREE pelvis + legs by a frozen locomotion policy taking a base
                      command. Action = 28 + 4 = **32**, laid out `[L wrist 7, R wrist 7, hands 14,
                      vx vy wz hip_height]` — deliberately Isaac Lab's own ordering for its G1
                      loco-manipulation task, so their retargeters and datasets line up with ours.
  - `loco_joint`    — the same legs under direct arm joint targets. Action = 31 + 4 = 35.

The `loco_*` modes REQUIRE `fixed_base=False`; `build_controller` refuses the combination rather
than let a welded pelvis silently run a walking policy. See `controllers/loco_policy.py` for what
the base command means and what the checkpoint expects back.

This is the first test of the layer design: the same scene + this robot, switch `control_mode`,
and `action_dim` / the controller follow. Heavy imports (isaaclab / isaaclab_assets) are deferred so
importing this module — and registering the robot — stays app-free.

================================================================================================
TODO (NOT built yet) — HAND VARIANT as a build-time option, like `fixed_base`. Notes for future:

The G1 hand is **build-time hardware**, not a control mode (new hardware -> new robot variant). Isaac
offers three hands and varies them two ways:
  - USD variant sets: `g1.usd` has `left_hand`/`right_hand` variant sets = {ThreeFinger, Inspire,
    None}, default ThreeFinger.
  - Separate cfgs: `G1_29DOF_CFG` -> `g1.usd` (ThreeFinger); `G1_INSPIRE_FTP_CFG` = a copy with
    `spawn.usd_path = ".../g1_29dof_inspire_hand.usd"`, `activate_contact_sensors=True`, and a
    **redefined** `actuators["hands"]` for the inspire joints.

To add it here: a `hand: str = "three_finger"` field on `G1RobotCfg` driving, in `assets()`,
(1) which USD / USD-variant to spawn, and (2) the hand joint set — so `HAND_JOINTS` (the joint-name
patterns) and the hand controller's `action_dim` become **variant-dependent** (3-finger=14 DOF !=
5-finger inspire != none=0). The whole `composite([arms, joint(hands)])` shape still holds; only the
hands leaf (its joints / DOF count) changes.

CAVEAT: the vendored `robots/assets/g1/g1.usd` is **ThreeFinger-only** — the Inspire variant was
pruned (~75 MB) by `robots/assets/fetch_g1.py` (PRUNE list). So `three_finger` works and `none` likely
does (adds nothing); `inspire` needs re-vendoring `g1_29dof_inspire_hand.usd` (or un-pruning + re-fetch).
